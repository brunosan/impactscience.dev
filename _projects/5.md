We did a comprehensive assessment of opportunities between Inmarsat services and the United Nations’ (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In particular in relation to [their partnership](https://www.inmarsat.com/about-us/what-we-do/digital-frontiers/) with the UK Space Agency’s International Partnership Programme (IPP). This is a five-year, £152 million program designed to partner UK space expertise with governments and organizations in emerging and developing economies around the world to deliver a sustainable economic or societal benefit.

In 2017 Inmarsat was awarded UK Space Agency IPP funding to lead three projects using satellite technology to improve and protect people’s lives in Nigeria, Indonesia and the Philippines. Sustainability was a key element of each of the two-year projects, with detailed monitoring and evaluation designed to demonstrate to respective governments their positive impact on target communities and cost effectiveness.

The IPP projects followed the UK Space Agency’s International Partnership Space Programme (IPSP) initiatives that Inmarsat undertook in 2015, supplying connectivity for mobile banking services in Kenya and a maternal healthcare programme in Nigeria.
