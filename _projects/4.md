The heart of any entrepreneurial ecosystem is the community of entrepreneurs themselves. [The Swiss Entrepreneurship Program](https://www.entrepreneur-in-residence.net/) (Swiss EP) has incorporated this belief and supports building local startup com-munities bottom up by working with ecosystem leaders and builders for the past four years. Our partners are mainly local entrepreneurs developing and managing incubators, accelerator programs, mentor and angel networks. Through our network of international entrepreneurs (short term experts and Entrepre-neurs-in-Residence) Swiss EP supports organizations to strengthen their performance, improve programs and deliver services of high value to their entrepreneurs, through strategic and practical advice as well as valuable international connections.
