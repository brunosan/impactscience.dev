The best solution for someone on a refugee camp is to cease being a refugee either by being able to come back to their communities or being relocated with full citizenship in another community. Our project seeks to upskill refugees so they gain agency on their present and future by being entrepreneurs which will hopefully increase their chances to move on.

This is a pro-bono project with other members of the World Economic Forum Young Global Leaders community, in cooperation with United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Oxford University Centre on Refugee Studies, Aliko Dangote Foundation and Danish Church Aid (DCA).
